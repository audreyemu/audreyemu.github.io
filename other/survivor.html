        <div class="title">Survivor @ UCLA</div>
        <div class="passage-text">I am a HUGE Survivor fan and grew up watching Survivor with my family every Wednesday night. I've watched almost every season from the last decade and in the past few years, this casual viewing has become of a slight obsession of mine. I'd walk to class with my headphones on. Listening to music? No, listening to a Survivor podcast! I'd be on my computer. Watching netflix? No, watching Survivor youtubers! Something about the social maneuvering mixed with strategic decisions really intrigued me.<br><br>
            During my first year at UCLA, I was studying at Young Research Library and found a flyer for Survivor at UCLA on the bathroom door. I always thought it would be fun to be part of this club, but I never actually considered applying until my roommate encouraged me to. During my second year, I decided to submit my application and video. I interviewed and got in! I was going to be a contestant on Season 5 of Suvivor at UCLA.<br><br>
